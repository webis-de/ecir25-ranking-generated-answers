Here's what you need to know:\nIntroduction:\nPsoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin condition characterized by red, flaky patches on the scalp, known as psoriatic plaques. While there is no cure for psoriasis, there are various treatment options available that can help manage symptoms. One such option is head patting, which involves gently massaging the affected area with your fingertips. In this answer, we will explore how head pats can benefit individuals with scalp psoriasis and provide tips on how to perform them effectively.\nHow does head patting work?:\nHead patting works by increasing blood flow to the affected area, thereby promoting healing and reducing inflammation. The gentle pressure applied during head patting also helps to reduce itching and discomfort associated with psoriasis. By stimulating nerve endings, head patting may also help to desensitize the brain from sending pain signals, leading to improved overall wellbeing.\nBenefits of head patting for scalp psoriasis:\n1. Reduces itching:\nHead patting can significantly reduce itching associated with scalp psoriasis, making life more comfortable for individuals suffering from this condition. Itching can lead to scratching, which can further irritate the skin and exacerbate psoriasis symptoms. By providing relief from itching through head patting, individuals can avoid unnecessary scratching and promote better skin health. \n2. Promotes healing:\nHead patting increases blood flow to the affected area, which promotes healing and reduces inflammation. This is particularly important for scalp psoriasis, where the scalp's natural barrier function can become compromised due to increased inflammation. By improving blood flow and reducing inflammation, head patting can aid in faster healing and recovery times for individuals with scalp psoriasis.\n3. Relieves stress:\nStress has been linked to worsening psoriasis symptoms, including those affecting the scalp. Head patting provides an excellent way to relieve tension and promote relaxation, helping individuals cope better",-0.0020957665983587
meta-llama_Llama-2-13b-chat-hf_132_multimedqa_9,"Hello! I'm here to help you with your question about headpats and scalp psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition that can cause red, itchy patches on the skin, including the scalp. Headpats, also known as scalp massages, can potentially aggravate or improve symptoms of scalp psoriasis, depending on how they are done and who does them. Here's what you need to know:\nWhat are headpats?\nHeadpats are gentle massages of the scalp using fingertips or a soft brush. They have been found to improve blood flow, reduce stress hormones, promote relaxation, and even boost hair growth in some cases. However, if performed too vigorously or by someone with unclean hands, headpats may irritate the scalp and worsen existing conditions like psoriasis. It's essential to consult a dermatologist before starting any new treatment, especially if you have sensitive skin or a history of allergies. What are the risks associated with headpats for people with psoriasis? For those living with psoriasis, excessive scratching can lead to further inflammation and skin thickening, making symptoms more challenging to manage. Unfortunately, many individuals may not be aware when they are scratching their heads too much due to its subconscious nature. This issue can become particularly problematic during periods of high stress or anxiety when emotional reactivity tends to increase hand-to-head contact frequency without conscious awareness. Additionally, certain techniques used in headpats - such as applying pressure with the fingers or using instruments like combs - could potentially exacerbate preexisting scalp conditions like psoriasis. How can headpats benefit people with psoriasis? Some research suggests that mild stimulation techniques like light touch, stroking, or vibration may offer therapeutic value for certain neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) by enhancing cognitive function via increased blood flow & oxygen delivery to brain regions under stress. The same principles might apply to managing localized inflammation in the context of psoriasis. By introducing controlled amounts of gentle trauma at specific intervals—using either manual manipulations or low-frequency",-0.0030377216171473

gpt2-large_132_multimedqa_7,"Yes. Head pats are one of the most effective treatments for psoriatic dermatitis. The skin that is afflicted with the disease produces a thin, oily outer layer that can be rubbed or scraped off in order to relieve itching. A small number of people do not respond well to this treatment; however, it has been shown to prevent or alleviate many other types of chronic diseases as well.\n\n Head pats may also be used to treat various other conditions such as eczema and psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), osteoarthritis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), asthma, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome/chronic constipation, and more. These problems can often be treated by using other methods of hair removal including scalp flaps, bandanas, and a variety of products such as shampoo, conditioner, gel, and waxes. Although a lot of research has gone into the efficacy of these techniques, there aren't any studies specifically on treating head lice. If you have questions regarding how to use these products, please see our FAQ page. \n\n What does the term ""head lice"" mean? The term ""head louse"" refers to an adult animal bite from a biting insect known as the European corn beetle, Neisseria meningitidis (European white bee). It was originally classified as a parasitic infestation because it could cause death when its eggs were ingested. However, over time, scientists determined that the larvae of the insect were actually developing within the host. Scientists believe that the larvae develop from the egg shells of a few species of bees throughout the world. There are two main subspecies in North America: European corn borer (Cynomastix europeanum) and Mexican corn borer (M. nigripes). While both of these pests live in warm temperate regions where they prefer to lay their eggs. They feed primarily on corn, soybean, peanuts, tree nuts, and fruit, but will attack almost anything else that fits their diet. During their larval stage, the adults form protective cocoons under leaves, twigs, and debris. In addition to attacking and killing the larvae, the adults also eat any nits or insects that come in contact with them while feeding. Because of their predatory nature, no type of protection is needed against these aggressive pests",-0.0199484545737504

Scalp psoriasis may also affect the back of the ears, forehead, and neck. Scalp psoriasis is a common condition. Experts estimate that psoriasis. If left untreated, it can cause more severe psoriasis symptoms. It also causes chronic inflammation that’s been linked to serious conditions such as: Treatment for scalp psoriasis varies based on its severity and location. Generally, psoriasis treatments to the head, neck, and face are gentler than treatments used on other parts of the body. There is anecdotal evidence that some home treatments may help reduce scalp psoriasis symptoms. These are best used in conjunction with medical treatments that have been proven effective in treating this condition. There are several types of psoriasis, ranging from mild to severe. Scalp psoriasis is a form of , which is the most common type. It causes silvery-red, scaly patches, known as plaques, and can affect any part of the body. Plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis that affects the head, face, or neck. Scientists aren’t exactly sure what causes scalp and other kinds of psoriasis. They think it happens when a person’s immune system isn’t working properly. Someone with psoriasis may produce more of certain types of white blood cells called T cells and neutrophils. The job of T cells is to travel through the body, fighting off viruses and bacteria. If a person has too many T cells, they may begin to attack healthy cells by mistake and produce more skin cells and white blood cells. These cells appear on the skin where they cause inflammation, redness, patches, and flaking in the case of scalp psoriasis. Lifestyle and genetics may also be related to psoriasis. The following factors may increase your risk of scalp psoriasis: Having one parent with scalp psoriasis greatly increases your risk of having the condition. You have an even greater risk of developing the condition if both your parents have it. Those with excess weight appear to more commonly develop scalp psoriasis. Those who are also tend to have more skin creases and folds where some inverse psoriasis rashes tend to form. Your risk of psoriasis is increased if you .

623cac2f-8c41-4b17-a236-9b10ea98dcd2,"Psoriasis, the skin disease that plagues around 7.5 million Americans, can lead to unsightly flare-ups anywhere on the body, but it can be particularly embarrassing when it occurs on the scalp, where it's harder to hide. Symptoms such as itchiness; redness; raised lesions; flaky, dandruff-like scales; a burning sensation; and temporary hair loss can make the person with psoriasis extremely self-conscious and possibly even depressed. As bad as the appearance of scalp psoriasis can seem, the unpredictability of the condition can be even worse. As a disorder of the immune system, it often goes into remission. Such an event, however, can't be planned -- nor can an outbreak. Another challenge of scalp psoriasis is addressing the many variations of severity. One outbreak might lead to a hardly noticeable patch while another one might cover the entire scalp and even extend to the forehead, back of the neck and the area behind the ears. There is good news, however. If you suffer from scalp psoriasis, you don't have to hang your head in shame or spend weeks covering your scalp with wigs and hats. There are effective treatments -- both medical, over-the-counter and home -- for this condition. To find out what they are and if they'll work for you, check out the following pages. Before you seek a treatment for your scalp psoriasis, it's best to understand what type of outbreak you're experiencing. Psoriasis is usually categorized as mild, moderate or severe. To determine how severe yours is, consider how much of your scalp (or body) is covered by the outbreak. As a general rule of thumb, a moderate psoriasis outbreak tends to cover between 3 percent and 10 percent of the body. To visualize this, look at the size of one of your palms; it's approximately 1 percent of your body. Now, imagine an area three to 10 times that size. If your outbreak is smaller than that visual standard, you probably have mild psoriasis; if it's larger, you can consider your case to be severe. A more straightforward way of evaluating the severity of your condition is to consider the impact it has on your life. If you find your scalp psoriasis symptoms to be particularly bothersome and limiting, then you can likely label your outbreak as severe. Either way, you will want to be sure to share the details of your scalp psoriasis with your doctor so that he or she can provide the best treatment to target your category of outbreak. Find out more about such treatments on the next page. Psoriasis is an immune system disorder in which a T cell (T lymphocyte) attacks healthy skin cells as if they were invaders like bacteria or viruses. As a result, the skin cell growth cycle speeds up. This rapid turnover is what leads to the undesirable symptoms of psoriasis. It makes sense that a treatment for a skin condition is one that would be put on the skin. In fact, one of the most frequently used remedies for scalp psoriasis is a topical medication known as anthralin. It's",-0.372458815574646
