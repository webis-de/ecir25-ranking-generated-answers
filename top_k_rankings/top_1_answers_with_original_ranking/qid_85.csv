The attacks are often more severe than the remission periods and can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, numbness, and problems with coordination. The disease is typically diagnosed through a combination of clinical evaluation, MRI scans, and other imaging tests. There are several treatment options available for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, including medications to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, and slow the progression of the disease. These treatments are often tailored to each individual's specific symptoms and needs, and may include physical therapy and other supportive care.

RRMS is characterized by clearly defined relapses or exacerbations that are separated by periods of partial or complete recovery (remission). During these relapses, new symptoms may appear, or existing ones may worsen or resolve completely. The disease course of RRMS can be highly variable and unpredictable, with some individuals experiencing frequent relapses while others experience few or no relapses over several years. The exact cause of RRMS is still not fully understood, but it is believed to involve an autoimmune response, genetic predisposition, and environmental factors such as vitamin D status and smoking history. There is currently no cure for RRMS, but various treatments are available to manage symptoms and slow disease progression. These include disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) such as interferons, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, and alemtuzumab, which aim to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. In addition, steroids, pain management medication, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy may also be prescribed as needed. It's essential for patients with RRMS to work closely with their healthcare team to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses their specific needs and monitors their condition regularly for any changes or complications. Living with RRMS requires significant lifestyle adjustments and ongoing self-management strategies to optimize quality of life and maintain independence.

chatgpt_85_multimedqa_5,"Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most common form of multiple sclerosis (MS). It is characterized by clearly defined episodes of new or worsening neurological symptoms, known as relapses, followed by periods of partial or complete recovery, known as remissions. During relapses, individuals with RRMS may experience a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, difficulty walking, numbness or weakness in limbs, muscle spasms, problems with coordination and balance, blurred vision, and cognitive changes. These symptoms occur due to the immune system mistakenly attacking the protective covering of nerve fibers (myelin) in the central nervous system. The remission periods in RRMS can vary in duration and may involve partial or complete recovery from the symptoms experienced during relapses. However, even during remission, some individuals may continue to experience residual symptoms or have ongoing disease activity that is not clinically apparent. The exact cause of RRMS is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Certain risk factors, such as a family history of MS, certain infections, smoking, and low vitamin D levels, have been associated with an increased likelihood of developing RRMS. Diagnosis of RRMS involves a comprehensive evaluation of medical history, neurological examination, and the use of imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to detect characteristic brain and spinal cord lesions. Treatment for RRMS aims to manage symptoms, slow disease progression, and reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are commonly prescribed to modify the immune response and decrease the frequency and severity of relapses. These DMTs may include injectable medications, oral medications, or infusions. Additionally, symptomatic treatments may be used to manage specific symptoms experienced by individuals with RRMS. It is important for individuals with RRMS to work closely with their healthcare providers to develop a personalized management plan that may include a combination of medications, physical and occupational therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Regular monitoring and follow-up visits are essential to ensure the effectiveness of the chosen treatment approach and to address any new symptoms or concerns that may arise.",-0.0104068713262677

This characteristics of this type of MS is discussed. MS: Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) Menu In 1999, an international panel published a classification of multiple sclerosis (MS) that defined different forms of MS. One of these, the most common form, was relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Relapsing-remitting MS is defined as MS in which patients have relapses of MS and periods of stability in between relapses. Relapses are episodes of new or worsening symptoms not caused by or infection and that last more than 48 hours. In other words, a stable course is punctuated by episodes of new or worse symptoms. Relapsing-remitting MS is the most common initial form of MS. Younger patients are more likely to have this form of MS than older patients. What are the symptoms of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis? The symptoms of RRMS vary widely. Frequent early symptoms include: No two patients have the same symptoms. Some people are sensitive to heat. Some people get a tingling feeling when they bend their neck forward (Lhermitte's symptom). Some patients will have problems with weakness or unsteadiness of walking. Some combination of symptoms is common, and symptoms may vary over time in an individual.

It's characterized by episodes of relapses, followed by periods of remission. Here's what you need to know about relapsing-remitting MS:\nDefinition: Relapsing-remitting MS is the most common type of MS, accounting for around 85% of all cases. In this form of MS, patients experience clearly defined relapses, often accompanied by symptoms such as vision problems, muscle weakness or numbness/tingling in limbs, coordination difficulties, and cognitive impairments. These relapses are caused by inflammation and demyelination of CNS nerve fibers, leading to damage and scarring. After each relapse, there may be some recovery, but residual symptoms persist between relapses, which can worsen over time if left untreated. \nSymptoms: The specific symptoms experienced during a relapse will depend on the location and severity of the affected nerve fiber(s). Common relapsing-remitting MS symptoms include::\n* Vision problems: Blurred vision, double vision, loss of color perception, or blind spots in the field of vision are frequent complaints among people with MS. However, these visual disturbances usually resolve within several weeks after treatment starts. * Muscle weakness or fatigue: Weakness or tiredness in various parts of their body, especially those closest to where they had recently suffered an attack; this can sometimes lead to falls due to lack of balance control. This condition does not improve much without therapy either! * Numbness/Tingling sensations: Pins & Needles feeling along distribution pathways (usually involving more than one part of your body); tingly feelings tend to stay longer compared to other areas mentioned above. If left untreated, these discomforts could worsen further with passing days/weeks until eventually reaching permanent status. * Coordination difficulties: Clumsiness while walking, trouble coordinating movements when performing daily tasks like dressing oneself, using utensils during meals etcetera., even experiencing dizziness upon standing up quickly from sitting positions.

Integrin b3 and ACE2 linked by short linear motifs enabling endocytosis and autophagy of SARS-CoV-2 Study finds higher suicide rate among people with neurological disorders Drug prices beat inflation all the way even with discounts Multiple sclerosis follows a different course in every individual but there are three main ways in which the disease can progress depending on which form of the illness a patient has. Around 80% of all individuals with multiple sclerosis have the relapsing remitting form of the disease. These individuals have periods where their symptoms are mild or absent (remission), followed by periods of symptom relapse. Symptoms may occur suddenly and in acute bouts or exacerbations. During these periods of relapse, symptoms may become worse each time and the relapsing remitting form of this condition may eventually progress to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, where there are few or no periods of remission. Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis may be diagnosed when two episodes of relapse are separated by more than 30 days or there has only been one relapse but there is MRI evidence of newly scarred or damaged myelin three months later. Patients with this form of multiple sclerosis often experience phases of relapse followed by remission at first, but this later gives way to progressive disease, characterized by worsening symptoms and few or no periods of remission. The least common form of multiple sclerosis is the primary progressive form which occurs in about 10% to 15% of all cases and usually in people aged over 40 years. In this form of the condition, symptoms get worse over time rather than occurring in bouts or as sudden attacks. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis may be diagnosed if there have been no previous symptoms of relapse but the patient has become increasingly disabled over a period of at least one year. http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Multiple-sclerosis/Pages/Causes.aspx www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/tutorials/multiplesclerosis/nr229105.pdf http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/Atlas_MS_WEB.pdf http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/10930/29202/29202.pdf Last Updated: Aug 23, 2018 Dr. Ananya Mandal is a doctor by profession, lecturer by vocation and a medical writer by passion.

Some people with severe may lose the ability to walk independently or at all, while others may experience long periods of remission without any new symptoms. There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, treatments can help speed recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms. Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms may differ greatly from person to person and over the course of the disease depending on the location of affected nerve fibers. Symptoms often affect movement, such as: Numbness or weakness in one or more limbs that typically occurs on one side of your body at a time, or your legs and trunk Electric-shock sensations that occur with certain neck movements, especially bending the neck forward (Lhermitte sign) Partial or complete loss of vision, usually in one eye at a time, often with pain during eye movement See a doctor if you experience any of the above symptoms for unknown reasons.

bd20bf11-33b2-4bb1-89c0-958003dffffd,"— The activity of the Epstein-Barr virus in the body syncs up to relapses in patients with RRMS. In a new published on April 11, investigators in Italy found that, in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the immune response to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) appeared to cycle simultaneously with their disease activity, meaning that when the virus was active, so was their MS. The study, conducted by investigators at the Santa Lucia Foundation in Rome, Italy examined cytotoxic (CD8+) T-cells, which are cells that kill infected or abnormal cells in the body. They found an increased response to the antigens produced by active EBV in the blood of MS patients during relapses, as compared with samples taken during periods of remission. Antigens are substances that the body sees as foreign or harmful—including toxins from viruses like Epstein-Barr—and deploys an immune response to find and kill. EBV is a member of the herpesvirus family and, according to the (NIH), nearly 95 percent of all people between the ages of 35 and 40 have been infected by it. EBV is responsible for the viral infection known as mononucleosis (or “mono”). EBV only results in mono in 35 to 50 percent of patients, while others never show any outward signs that they’ve been infected. Although the symptoms of mono, which include a fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph glands, eventually go away, EBV takes up a permanent residence in certain cells in the immune system where it lies dormant for years. For people who suffer from RRMS, the cycles of disease activity can be as varied and irregular as the symptoms they produce. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. The immune system attacks the myelin, or protective covering, of nerve cells in the brain, causing electrical “shorts” in the signaling pathways. This can result in symptoms ranging from mild numbness to blindness or complete paralysis. In the relapsing-remitting form of MS, these attacks can last from a few days to several months. The flare-ups are followed by periods of remission where there is a lessening of disease activity. More than 400,000 people have been diagnosed with MS in the United States, and more than 1.2 million worldwide. According to the , about 80 to 85 percent of MS patients are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. In the study, investigators followed 113 patients with RRMS and 49 healthy control subjects over the course of four years, analyzing their blood in order to track their levels of CD8+ T-cell activity and map it to their MS disease cycles. Of the RRMS patients, 79 were on no disease modifying therapy, 20 were on Interferon Beta 1a, and 14 were on natalizumab, which is sold as Tysabri. Patients experiencing a relapse of their MS, verified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain, also showed elevated EBV activity as measured by the presence of the CD8+ T-cells. The researchers also studied the brain tissue of five MS patients who had donated their bodies to science.",-0.0280146915465593
146e4df7-ec0d-4b9e-9b4b-b034db97890e,"Think of Multiple Sclerosis as a Leaking Swimming Pool [Video] A new way of looking at the neurodegenerative disorder could lead to more and better treatments For 20 years neurologists have divided the neurological disorder multiple sclerosis (MS) into four distinct categories—subtypes that are supposed, in part, to help patients get the right treatments. But a new theory erases the distinctions between these groups and suggests that MS is a single disease after all. The idea was developed by Stephen Krieger, a neurologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, and presented in late April at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) annual meeting in Washington, D.C. If the theory holds up, it could lead to more effective management for a wider range of patients. In MS the body produces antibodies that attack the central nervous system, i.e. the brain and spinal cord. Specifically these antibodies ravage myelin, a fatty substance that insulates neurons, allowing them to conduct electricity. The nerves develop scars or sclerotic lesions (sclerosis is Greek for hard) in the aftermath of such attacks. As a result, patients can suffer from weakness, pain and walking difficulties—not to mention vision loss and a host of undesirable bowel, bladder and psychiatric ills. The current classification system arose as a way to describe the various ways MS symptoms tend to unfold. The most common type of MS is called relapsing-remitting disease; patients experience flare-ups—in which, for example, they suddenly lose vision in one eye—followed by periods of neurologic normalcy. Presumably their immune system has gone into overdrive when the flare-ups occur and then the activity subsides for months or even years. Less common are primary and secondary progressive MS. In the former, symptoms progress from the get-go and never remit; in the latter, patients first experience relapses and remissions but then progress to continuously worsening symptoms. Finally there’s progressive-relapsing MS in which patients experience continuously progressive disease on top of which more severe exacerbations occur. Krieger’s hypothesis is a metaphoric reunion of these four otherwise separate divisions of disease—one that can perhaps best be explained by analogy with a swimming pool in need of repair. Imagine a pool with mountains rising up from the bottom. The mountains represent scars in the central nervous system; the water surface is the threshold at which symptoms appear. Lesions below the water line do not cause symptoms whereas those jutting out of the water do. The water surface can also be seen as the body's neurologic reserve capacity. Our brains are astoundingly resilient: If one part of the brain is injured, neighboring neurons can step in and take over. But according to Krieger, as we age and as MS progresses, not only does the scarring worsen (that is, the mountains grow higher), the brain also loses its ability to compensate for injured tissue—meaning water starts draining out of the pool and more lesions and resulting symptoms become apparent. Krieger calls his view of MS the topographical model (referring to the mountains jutting out of the water). He believes his concept unites",-0.0294684953987598
gpt2-large_85_multimedqa_5,"We offer the latest data on relapses in MS treatment from the US National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS). In 2006, the NMSF updated its published relapsing-remitting criteria for MS. The revised criteria include more information on relapse rates in persons with CD, better definition of relapses, increased sensitivity of relapse diagnosis to severity and duration of disease, and a new clinical classification that incorporates more recent findings on relapse and progression toward disability. Relapse is defined as a clinical reappearance after 1 year or less without significant improvement and/or worsening. \nQuestion: What is the likelihood of recovery? Complete Answer: To be considered at least ""likely"" to make a full course of MS therapy for an extended period of time, a person must have a score of 6 points out of 8 on the modified FDS symptom scale. This figure was calculated using a weighted average of the scores of patients who had made full courses of MS therapy. Patients with more than 2 years of follow-up may not receive further treatment because they cannot show a significant improvement in their symptoms (the maximum score of 9 points on this scale will prevent consideration of any additional therapy beyond what would result in a full course of treatment.) \nQuestion: What is the most important factor in determining whether someone can benefit from MS therapies? Complete Answer: A patient's overall functional status should be assessed before the commencement of treatment. With the standard evaluation, the doctor performs a physical examination by taking x-rays of the spine, skin, joints, and back. If there is evidence of spinal damage, the doctors also perform evaluations of the cerebrospinal fluid. Also evaluated are mood and personality features. In addition, MRI scans and other tests might be required. \nQuestion: How is it determined if someone has relapsed? Complete Answer: There have been many studies of the prevalence of relapse among individuals with MS. For example, according to one study, 4% of people with MS reported having experienced a relapse during treatment, which indicates that more than half of those with MS will eventually experience a relapse. Another study found that 1% of people with MS were estimated to have relapsed after only 3 months of treatment. However, the relapse rate could vary depending upon the age of the individual and the length of time he or she has had the disorder. Although relapse is not a guaranteed outcome, some experts believe that as long as it is recognized, and treated appropriately, such as when medications are changed and lifestyle changes taken, relapse is relatively",-0.031634334474802
